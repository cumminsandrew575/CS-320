How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional first and foremost by testing it. In this course I learned about unit testing to verify the behavior of my functions or classes.
The best thing to do is test one thing at a time and to keep the tests independent of each other. This will help when scaling or implementing multiple classes.
For security purposes I learned that using AI to write programs can be dangerous due to cyber criminals "poisoning" the AI training data. It's also best practice
to use secure libraries and check when using third party libraries.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs by conducting interviews with the stakeholders. From these interviews I can create user stories to break down the necessary functions and features 
to implement into the software. Once I have the user studies I can write test cases to verify the functionality of the software.
Collaborate with your team and ensure that the most valuable features are being priotized.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software by first gathering the requirements. Once I understand what is expected of me I can begin to solve the problem.
Next I can write some pseudocode or a flowchart/ UML diagram. This will help show the flow of the software as well as help organize it.
Once I have the design I can start implementing the code. I have learned in this class that if I can test early I can catch any potential bugs from preventing the functionality of my program.
Refine the code and tests until it passes all tests. 
Once it passes the test I'm ready to deploy. 
I haven't worked this personally but lastly you would continue to maintain the program.
In between all those steps you have collaboration and communication with team members and stakeholders.
